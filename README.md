This is a set up scripts to make it easier to work with AWS EC2 while working on data projects for the
[Udacity self-driving-car nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/drive). These files were originally sourced
from a fellow CarND student, Alex Staravoitau's [blog post](http://navoshta.com/aws-tensorflow/). I've
altered the scripts slightly to work with the amazon base ami and to hide and private information so the
files are commitable.
