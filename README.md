This is a set up scripts to make it easier to work with AWS EC2 while working on data projects for the
[Udacity self-driving-car nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/drive). These files were originally sourced
from a fellow CarND student, Alex Staravoitau's [blog post](http://navoshta.com/aws-tensorflow/). I've
altered the scripts slightly to work with the carnd ami and to hide and private information so the
files are commitable. Working with the carnd ami is desirerable because it comes preloaded with some
large projects such as tensorflow and anaconda. 

To allow for customizability, I am adding some of the files here to S3 so they can be downloaded and run on
the ec2 instance. 

Instead of running the carnd ami, I could also run a script such as [this](https://github.com/Avsecz/aws-tensorflow-setup). Which comes from [this blog](http://max-likelihood.com/2016/06/18/aws-tensorflow-setup/).
